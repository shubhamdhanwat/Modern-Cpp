Types of common logic building exercise :


1)Total or algebraic sum operation
--1)create an initial total variable with initial value as 0
--2)for each item to be added in the total , do the following 
    a)fetch the item
    b)add the item to the sum
    c)update the sum
---3)return the final sum


2)Find min value from the collection 

eg:find the lowest (minimum ) interger from an array

---1)create a initial min value WHICH MUST BE EQUAL TO THE FIRST ITEM FROM THE collection
```2)for each item in the collection do the following 
        a)fetch the item 
        b)compare the item with the "MIN VALUE "so far
            b1)if current item is larger than min_value ,"ignore"
            b2)if current item is smaller , update min_value value
----3)finally , the min_value now holds the "global minima"


3)Find the attribute associated with the "min " value object

eg:finding the car with  min mileage and returning this mileage 

---1)create an initial min value WHICH MUST BE EQUAL TO THE FIRST ITEM FROM THE collection
---2)also save the attribute (to be returned ) of the first item
----3)for each object , do the following
    a)compare and check whether current val is lower than min   
    b)if yes, update min, update associated value
    c)if no, ignore 
----4)return the associated value
